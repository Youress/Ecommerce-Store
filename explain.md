**getting the products**
**class products**


It looks like you're using the map function to transform an array of products by extracting specific properties from each item in the array. The resulting array seems to contain objects with title, price, id, and image properties.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening in your code:

Initialize the products Array:

let products = data.items;
Assuming data.items is an array of items, you are assigning it to the variable products.

Use map to Transform Each Item:

products = products.map((item) => {
  // Destructure properties from the 'fields' and 'sys' objects
  const { title, price } = item.fields;
  const { id } = item.sys;

  // Extract the 'image' property from the 'fields' object
  const image = item.fields.image.fields.file.url;

  // Return a new object with the extracted properties
  return { title, price, id, image };
});
The map function is used to iterate over each item in the products array. For each item, it extracts specific properties using object destructuring (title, price, id) from the fields and sys objects. Additionally, it extracts the image property from the nested fields.image.fields.file.url path. The resulting object is then returned.

After this code executes, the products array is transformed, and each item in the array is now an object with properties title, price, id, and image.
